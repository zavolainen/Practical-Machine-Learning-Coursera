# Practical-Machine-Learning-Coursera

This report is part of the Coursera Practical Machine Learning course. 
My goal is to develope a model based on the Human Activity Recognition 
Weight Lifting data to predict the type of exercise. I ended up using 
the Random Forest model. 

The report consists of the rmd file which is knitted to md and html 
files.
